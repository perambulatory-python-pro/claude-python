# Conversation with Claude

## Human:

this is the latest results from some of our code. We improved the mapping of job code to 100%, but business unit and building code are at 100%


## Claude:

Looking at your code execution results, I can see you're working on a sophisticated data transformation system that processes invoice data for your security services billing. Let me break down what's happening here and explain the Python concepts involved.


What Your Script is Doing


Your `python_fix_dimension_lookups.py` script appears to be performing a multi-step ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process:


1. Loading Reference Data (Dimension Tables)
  - EMID to job_code lookup (61 entries)
  - 7,695 invoices
  - 381 buildings
  - 1,153 job mappings
2. Transforming Invoice Data
  - Processing BCI (appears to be one client) invoice details: 25,902 records
  - Processing AUS (another client/location) invoice details: 24,525 records
3. Combining and Validating Data
  - Merged to create 50,427 total records
  - Checking data quality/field population
4. Field Population Results
  - business_unit: 0/50,427 filled (0.0%) ❌
  - job_code: 50,427/50,427 filled (100.0%) ✅
  - emid: 50,427/50,427 filled (100.0%) ✅
  - building_code: 0/50,427 filled (0.0%) ❌


Key Python Concepts at Work


1. Pandas DataFrames


Your script is heavily using pandas for data manipulation. The warning about DataFrame concatenation suggests you're using:


```python
# Less efficient approach (what you're likely doing)
df = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)

# More efficient approach (what pandas recommends)
unified_df = pd.concat([bci_df, aus_df], ignore_index=True)
```


2. Data Transformation Pipeline


This is a classic ETL pattern where you:


- Extract: Load data from CSV/Excel files
- Transform: Apply lookups, clean data, standardize formats
- Load: Export to a final unified format


3. Lookup/Mapping Operations


The script is performing dimension lookups - a common pattern in data warehousing where you map codes to their full descriptions:


```python
# Example of what's likely happening
invoice_df['job_code'] = invoice_df['emid'].map(emid_to_job_lookup)
```


Why Business Unit and Building Code Aren't Populating


Based on the 0% fill rate for business_unit and building_code, there are a few likely causes:


1. Missing Lookup Data: The reference tables might not have the necessary mappings
2. Key Mismatch: The join keys might not be matching (case sensitivity, data types, extra spaces)
3. Logic Issue: The transformation logic might be looking for the wrong fields


Recommendations for Improvement


1. Debug the Failed Lookups


Add diagnostic code to understand why mappings are failing:


```python
# Check for unmatched values
unmatched_business_units = invoice_df[invoice_df['business_unit'].isna()]['some_key_field'].unique()
print(f"Unmatched keys for business_unit: {unmatched_business_units[:10]}")

# Check if lookup tables have the expected data
print(f"Sample of business unit lookup: {business_unit_lookup.head()}")
```


2. Implement Data Quality Checks


```python
def validate_lookups(df, lookup_dict, key_col, target_col):
    """Validate why lookups might be failing"""
    missing_keys = df[~df[key_col].isin(lookup_dict.keys())][key_col].unique()
    if len(missing_keys) > 0:
        print(f"Keys in data but not in lookup: {missing_keys[:5]}")
    return missing_keys
```


3. Consider Your Business Context


Given that you're processing invoices for a large healthcare system with 140,000 hours of weekly service, data accuracy is critical. The 100% success on job_code and emid shows the core mapping is working, but the missing business_unit and building_code could impact:


- Cost center allocation
- Location-based billing
- Financial reporting by business unit


Next Steps


1. Investigate the lookup tables for business_unit and building_code
2. Add logging to see which specific records are failing to match
3. Verify the join keys are in the expected format
4. Consider creating a data quality report that shows which clients/locations are missing these dimensions


Would you like me to help you write some diagnostic code to troubleshoot why the business_unit and building_code lookups are failing?


## Human:

Please reference my GitHub, I have added a markdown file that contains our chat from yesterday where we built many scripts dealing with this process of mapping codes and standardizing invoice details. The scripts are also available in my GitHub.

Once you have brought yourself up to speed on our work, let's review our next steps for troubleshooting why we are now at 0% business unit and building code matching. This may be because we need to change the order of our lookups, where the lookups are pointing, or verifying the formatting is the same. But, let's see what you think once you review everything.


## Claude:

After reviewing your GitHub and the extensive conversation from yesterday, I can see the full picture of what we built together. Let me analyze why business_unit and building_code are showing 0% population after our fixes.


The Issue


Looking at the conversation history and the scripts, I can identify the problem:


1. In the original EDI-based transformer, we were relying on EDI data for lookups, but:
  - EDI data doesn't contain business_unit
  - The building dimension was created from EDI, which has buildings, but business_unit comes from the reference file
2. The fix we attempted (`fix_dimension_lookups.py`) was on the right track, but there's a critical issue:
  - We're creating the lookups in `create_lookups()`
  - But in the transform methods, we're still primarily using EDI lookups
  - The business_unit lookup from building_dim isn't being used correctly


The Root Cause


Looking at the `edi_based_transformer.py` transform methods:


```python
# In transform_bci_row
building_code = invoice_dims.get('BUILDING_CODE')

# Get business unit from building dimension
if building_code and building_code in self.building_lookup:
    business_unit = self.building_lookup[building_code].get('BUSINESS_UNIT')
else:
    business_unit = None
```


The problem is that `invoice_dims` (from EDI) might not have the building_code, or the building_code might not be in our building_lookup.


Solution


We need to enhance the lookup logic to:


1. First try EDI lookup (for EMID and service area)
2. Then enhance with reference data (for business_unit and other fields)
3. For AUS, use the job number → building code → business unit chain


Here's the fix we need to implement:


```python
def transform_bci_row(self, row: pd.Series, row_idx: int, source_file: str) -> Optional[UnifiedInvoiceDetail]:
    """Enhanced BCI transformation with proper lookups"""
    try:
        # Get invoice dimensions from EDI
        invoice_no = str(row['Invoice_No'])
        invoice_dims = self.get_invoice_dimensions(invoice_no)
        
        # Initialize variables
        emid = None
        service_area = None
        building_code = None
        business_unit = None
        job_code = None
        
        if invoice_dims:
            # Use EDI dimensions
            emid = invoice_dims['EMID']
            service_area = invoice_dims['SERVICE_AREA']
            building_code = invoice_dims.get('BUILDING_CODE')
        
        # Try to get building code from location number if not in EDI
        if not building_code:
            location_number = str(row.get('Location_Number', ''))
            if location_number:
                # Check if location_number is actually a building code
                if location_number in self.building_lookup:
                    building_code = location_number
                # Or try the BCI reference lookup
                elif location_number in self.building_by_loc_ref:
                    building_info = self.building_by_loc_ref[int(location_number)]
                    building_code = building_info.get('building_code')
        
        # Now get business unit from building
        if building_code and building_code in self.building_lookup:
            building_info = self.building_lookup[building_code]
            business_unit = building_info.get('BUSINESS_UNIT')
            
            # If we didn't have EMID from EDI, get it from building
            if not emid:
                emid = building_info.get('EMID')
                if emid and emid in self.service_area_lookup:
                    service_area = self.service_area_lookup[emid]['MC SERVICE AREA']
        
        # Get job_code from EMID
        if emid and emid in self.emid_to_job_code:
            job_code = self.emid_to_job_code[emid]
```


Next Steps


1. Update the transformer to use a hierarchical lookup strategy:
  - EDI first (for invoice-level data)
  - Then reference files (for dimensional data)
  - Then fallback strategies
2. Add diagnostic logging to see where lookups fail:
python`if not business_unit:
    self.transformation_stats['warnings'].append(
        f"No business_unit found for building_code: {building_code}"
    )`
3. Verify the data chain:
  - Invoice → Building Code (via EDI or location number)
  - Building Code → Business Unit (via building reference)
  - EMID → Job Code (via EMID reference)
4. For AUS specifically, the chain should be:
  - Job Number → Building Code (via master lookup)
  - Building Code → Business Unit (via building reference)


Would you like me to create a complete updated version of the transformer that properly chains these lookups together? The key is to use multiple lookup strategies and fall back gracefully when the primary lookup fails.


## Human:

Data chain is as follows: 
1. EDI Data gives us multiple important data points: 
   1. Invoice No. - this is the key to matching with invoice details
   2. EMID + MC SERVICE AREA - (calling out both columns since those are 1:1 matches) - This may be needed to join to other datasets later
   3. Full GL String - this is columns GL BU, LOC, DEPT, and ACCT. These can show up in other datasets and one string as GL BU-LOC-DEPT-ACCT. The LOC column is important as it can serve as a check for the building code matching - kp_loc_ref is a field in the buildings table on the buildings sheet in the file emid_job bu_table.xlsx. I am attaching that file again for ease of reference for you.
   4. KP bldg - this is the building_code and is attached to around 80% of the invoices. Those that are missing building data may require further investigating, but we may be able to look these up with our other joins we are discussing here.
   5. Please note that the BUSINESS UNIT column on the EDI file is NOT the same as the business_unit field on the buildings sheet/table in the emid_job_bu_table.xlsx. For join/matching purposes, the BUSINESS UNIT field from EDI should be ignored/not used.
2. emid_job_bu_table.xlsx:
   1. First sheet, emid_job_code table: 
      1. This contains emid which will immediately give us a match to the invoice based upon its EMID. We also know that mc_service_area is a 1:1 match to emid.
      2. region - this is the region field that should be carried over to the full report as building_region, as this is the region that matches the building code data provided by the customer. The REGION field on the EDI file should be carried over as onelink_region as this is the region reference in the customer's AP system. Confusing, I know, but this directly helps with tying it to the correct terminology and groupings depending upon which customer group we are providing analysis (operations uses building data, accounts payable uses onelink data). 
      3. job_code - this is our QuickBooks Job Code for each of the various accounts. Some EMID belong to the same job code, which is fine.
      4. description - this ties directly, 1:1 with our job codes and is simply the name of the account in our QuickBooks instance.
   2. Second sheet, buildings table
      1. emid/mc service area - already explained, in cleaner snowflake, would not need to house mc_service_area here since it lives on another table with emid, but it is not hurting anything at this time to have both here. Is that correct?
      2. building_code - each building code we have identified as active, but if there are any on the edi OR invoice details files that are not found here, we may need to reference the other, larger buildings table from the Buildings sheet in the 2025_Master Lookup...V3.xlsx file.
      3. kp_loc_ref - this can be used to assist with looking up building codes on the EDI if one does not exist.
      4. business_unit - as mentioned in the EDI file notes above, this business_unit is the building code's "Service Area" which they also call the business_unit. since we already use mc_service_area, but we also already have a different business unit referenced via EDI, we should alter the name of this business unit to bldg_business_unit or something similar to clearly identify it as associated to the building code and not the other BUSINESS UNIT field.
3. 2025_Master Lookup_Validation Location with GL Reference_V3.xlsx
   1. Sheet One - Master Lookup
      1. I removed the super header from row 1, so now row 1 contains all headers. I have also updated the column that should be used for building code matching, which is now named building_code.
      2. EMID, MC SERVICE AREA - same as others and can be used to join related information.
      3. Operational/Market Area: This will have similarities to the buildings table business_unit, but will not match 1:1. Again, this is used by a different group and how they associate areas, so we will need to track this one separately.
      4. REGION - this will more than likely match the EDI REGION data, and is directly related to the EMID/MC SERVICE AREA, so this is likely redundant.
      5. Service Area - This is internal to AUS/BCI and how we categorize the areas in our systems. Most that start with "BCI -" are actually AUS data points as this is how they categorize the work as our subcontractor.
      6. Location/Job No - this is a reference point from both AUS and BCI and are codes in our respective systems. There are duplicates of these fields, and when there are multiple matches for this, there needs to be subsequent lookups to match to the appropriate building code. This happens because of how we use the same type of charge, such as SCAL REGIONAL TRAINING MANAGERS and apply that across all of our SCAL customers pro rata to their master schedule hours against the lot. So, SCLTRN will be the Location (BCI reference) in the Location/Job No field, and that can appear multiple times. When that occurs, in order to get the proper building code, a subsequent lookup should look to match the EMID. Once those are matched, the building code should be identified without duplicate. If we encounter some where even after matching EMID and Location/Job No there are still multiple possible building_codes, that should be flagged/identified so we can further investigate and determine if we can then do another subsequent lookup to get us to only 1 possible building code.
      7. The remaining fields are not as critical for lookups/dimensions except for the following:
         1. GL BU, LOC, DEPT, ACCT, PU BU, PROJ, KP LOC Ref, and building_code.
   2. Sheet 2 - Buildings:
      1. Region - will match region from buildings table in emid_job...file.
      2. Service Area (Business Unit) - this is where I am pulling the business_unit field from in the buildings table referenced above. 
      3. Operational/Market Area - this is where this data point originates. It is referenced in the Master Lookup and elsewhere, but is directly tied to the buildings in this list.
      4. Building Code - Obvious, but this is where the building codes referenced everywhere else originate.
      5. The Remaining fields are not critical to joins and matches at this time, but we should maintain the ability to call these in the future.
4. invoice_details_aus.csv:
   1. Invoice Number, Job Number, and (potentially) Customer Number should be the only fields required for joins to this dataset, other than when we are going to connect it to the SCR, but that is not the scope of this task currently and will be handled independently later.
5. invoice_details_bci.csv:
   1. Customer - this field needs to extract the string after the ":". Once this is parsed/extracted, it will match directly to the job_code in the emid_job_code table.
   2. Customer_Number_Ext - this is our current way of breaking out the customers further, so when you see the same Customer but different customer extensions, when you then look to Location, you will find the Location Name and Location Number are different, which can tie to different buildings/groupings. This is more important right now than it will be once we fully transition to self-performing. Here's why: Currently, our Job Codes are not as details as the information in the table provided. We have some employees at locations where AUS provides MOST of the labor (we provide Managers, Healthcare Protection Officers, Armed Protection Officers, etc.) and AUS provides Assistant Managers and the Security Officers. For those locations, we have been grouping all of the work into KSP:NCL or KSP:SCL and then using the extensions and location name and location number to track the detail of where exactly the charges belong. As we move to fully self-performing these remaining locations, we are activating the new Job Codes and putting ALL charges into that new job code for the locations associated with it. If this is confusing or complicates things let me know and we can discuss it further to determine how to manage this with existing data and then moving forward during and post the self-performing transition.
   3. The remaining fields should not be necessary for joins and matching, unless the position and position numbers come into play when drilling down further to match buildings as mentioned previously with the Master Lookup and Location/Job No situation.

I believe this captures the bulk of the fields and their various relationships. Does this help? Let's talk through this and ensure we are aligned prior to finalizing our plan and creating/updating scripts, please.


## Claude:

Thank you for this incredibly detailed explanation! This really clarifies the complex relationships between your various data sources. Let me summarize my understanding and then propose a solution for fixing the 0% business_unit and building_code matching issue.


Understanding Your Data Architecture


Key Insights:


1. EDI is the authoritative source for Invoice → EMID mapping
2. Building codes come from multiple sources:
  - EDI: `KP bldg` field (~80% populated)
  - BCI: Location_Number might be a building code
  - AUS: Job Number → Master Lookup → building_code
3. Multiple "business unit" concepts:
  - EDI `BUSINESS UNIT` → Ignore for matching
  - Buildings table `business_unit` → Rename to `bldg_business_unit` (Service Area grouping)
  - Master Lookup `Operational/Market Area` → Separate operational grouping
4. Region complexity:
  - EDI `REGION` → `onelink_region` (AP system)
  - emid_job_code `region` → `building_region` (operations)


The Problem with Current Implementation


Looking at our current `edi_based_transformer.py`, I see the issues:


1. We're not using the EDI `KP bldg` field - This is why building_code is 0%
2. We're looking for `BUSINESS_UNIT` in the wrong place - It's in the buildings reference, not EDI
3. We're not handling the LOC → kp_loc_ref → building_code fallback


Proposed Solution


Here's how we should restructure the lookups:


```python
class EDIBasedTransformer:
    def create_lookups(self):
        """Enhanced lookups with all the relationships"""
        # ... existing code ...
        
        # Add LOC to building lookup (via kp_loc_ref)
        self.loc_to_building = {}
        for _, row in self.building_df.iterrows():
            if pd.notna(row.get('kp_loc_ref')):
                loc_ref = str(int(row['kp_loc_ref']))  # Convert to string without decimal
                self.loc_to_building[loc_ref] = row['building_code']
    
    def get_invoice_dimensions(self, invoice_number: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
        """Get all dimensional data for an invoice from EDI"""
        invoice_str = str(invoice_number).strip()
        
        # Direct lookup in EDI
        if invoice_str in self.invoice_lookup:
            edi_data = self.invoice_lookup[invoice_str]
            
            # Start with EDI data
            result = {
                'EMID': edi_data['EMID'],
                'SERVICE_AREA': edi_data['SERVICE_AREA'],
                'BUILDING_CODE': edi_data.get('KP bldg'),  # This is the key!
                'GL_BU': edi_data.get('GL BU'),
                'LOC': edi_data.get('LOC'),
                'DEPT': edi_data.get('DEPT'),
                'ACCT': edi_data.get('ACCT'),
                'ONELINK_REGION': edi_data.get('REGION')  # Renamed
            }
            
            # If no building code in EDI, try LOC lookup
            if not result['BUILDING_CODE'] and result.get('LOC'):
                loc_str = str(result['LOC'])
                if loc_str in self.loc_to_building:
                    result['BUILDING_CODE'] = self.loc_to_building[loc_str]
            
            self.transformation_stats['invoices_matched'] += 1
            return result
        
        # ... handle revision logic ...
        
    def transform_bci_row(self, row: pd.Series, row_idx: int, source_file: str) -> Optional[UnifiedInvoiceDetail]:
        """Transform a single BCI row using EDI dimensions"""
        try:
            invoice_no = str(row['Invoice_No'])
            invoice_dims = self.get_invoice_dimensions(invoice_no)
            
            # Initialize all fields

                # Get from EDI
                emid = invoice_dims['EMID']
                service_area = invoice_dims['SERVICE_AREA']
                building_code = invoice_dims.get('BUILDING_CODE')
                onelink_region = invoice_dims.get('ONELINK_REGION')
                
                # Get building info if we have building code
                if building_code and building_code in self.building_lookup:
                    building_info = self.building_lookup[building_code]
                    bldg_business_unit = building_info.get('BUSINESS_UNIT')  # This is the service area from buildings
                
                # Get EMID info
                if emid:
                    # Get job_code and building_region
                    if emid in self.emid_to_job_code:
                        job_code = self.emid_to_job_code[emid]
                    
                    if emid in self.service_area_lookup:
                        emid_info = self.service_area_lookup[emid]
                        building_region = emid_info.get('REGION')
            
            # Parse Customer field for job_code fallback
            if not job_code and pd.notna(row.get('Customer')):
                customer_str = str(row['Customer'])
                if ':' in customer_str:
                    job_code_candidate = customer_str.split(':', 1)[1].strip()
                    # Verify this job_code exists
                    if job_code_candidate in self.job_code_to_emid:
                        job_code = job_code_candidate
```


Implementation Plan


1. Update dimension_table_creator.py:
  - Rename `BUSINESS_UNIT` to `BLDG_BUSINESS_UNIT` in building dimension
  - Add `ONELINK_REGION` and `BUILDING_REGION` fields
2. Fix edi_based_transformer.py:
  - Use EDI `KP bldg` as primary source for building_code
  - Implement LOC → kp_loc_ref → building_code fallback
  - Rename business_unit fields appropriately
  - Add Customer parsing for BCI job_code
3. Handle AUS Job Number lookups:
  - Job Number → Master Lookup → building_code
  - Handle duplicates with EMID matching


Would you like me to create the updated scripts with these fixes? The key issue is that we weren't using the EDI `KP bldg` field, which is why building_code was 0%. Once we fix this, the business_unit lookup should cascade properly.


## Human:

One correction: from Key Insights: 2. BCI:Location_Number is NOT a building code. EDI Data #1. If not building code, use invoice number to match to the invoice_details file. From invoice_details file, get Location_Number, then match to the Master Lookup table, matching to column Location/Job No. Once matched, look for unique building code. If multiple matches with different building codes, use EMID from Invoice data to match to the EMID on the Master Lookup. Once the EMIDs are matched and Location_Number to Location/Job No are matched, there should only be 1 unique building code for that combination. If there are multiple, flag these for further investigation so we can add to the lookup logic for these situations.

Is that clearer?

Yes, much clearer! Thank you for the correction. So Location_Number is NOT a building code directly - it needs to go through the Master Lookup table to find its building code. Let me revise my understanding:


Corrected BCI Building Code Lookup Chain:


1. Primary: Use EDI `KP bldg` field directly
2. Fallback: If no building code in EDI:
  - Get invoice from EDI → match to invoice_details_bci.csv
  - Get Location_Number from invoice_details
  - Match Location_Number to Master Lookup `Location/Job No` column
  - If single building_code found → use it
  - If multiple building_codes found:
    - Use EMID from EDI to filter Master Lookup rows
    - Match EMID + Location/Job No → should give unique building_code
    - If still multiple → flag for investigation


Updated Implementation:


```python
def get_bci_building_code_fallback(self, invoice_number: str, location_number: str) -> Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str]]:
    """
    Fallback logic for BCI building code lookup
    Returns: (building_code, warning_message)
    """
    if not location_number:
        return None, "No Location_Number provided"
    
    # Look up in Master Lookup where Location/Job No matches Location_Number
    matches = self.master_lookup_df[
        self.master_lookup_df['Location/Job No'] == location_number
    ]
    
    if len(matches) == 0:
        return None, f"Location_Number {location_number} not found in Master Lookup"
    
    # Get unique building codes
    unique_building_codes = matches['building_code'].dropna().unique()
    
    if len(unique_building_codes) == 1:
        return unique_building_codes[0], None
    
    elif len(unique_building_codes) > 1:
        # Multiple building codes - need EMID to disambiguate
        # Get EMID from EDI for this invoice
        invoice_dims = self.get_invoice_dimensions(invoice_number)
        if invoice_dims and invoice_dims.get('EMID'):
            emid = invoice_dims['EMID']
            
            # Filter matches by EMID
            emid_matches = matches[matches['EMID'] == emid]
            emid_building_codes = emid_matches['building_code'].dropna().unique()
            
            if len(emid_building_codes) == 1:
                return emid_building_codes[0], None
            elif len(emid_building_codes) > 1:
                return None, f"Multiple building codes for Location {location_number} + EMID {emid}: {emid_building_codes}"
            else:
                return None, f"No building codes found for Location {location_number} + EMID {emid}"
        else:
            return None, f"Multiple building codes for Location {location_number}, but no EMID available"
    
    return None, f"No building codes found for Location {location_number}"
```


AUS Building Code Lookup Chain:


For AUS, it's similar but uses Job Number:


1. Job Number from invoice_details_aus.csv
2. Match to Master Lookup `Location/Job No`
3. Same disambiguation logic with EMID if needed


This makes much more sense - Location_Number is a reference that needs to be resolved through the Master Lookup, not a direct building code. Thank you for clarifying!


Should I proceed with creating the updated transformer with this corrected logic?


## Human:

Yes, you nailed it! Proceed with the updated transformer. Thank you!


## Claude:

Perfect! I'll create the updated transformer with the corrected logic. This will fix the 0% building_code and business_unit issues.

This fixed transformer addresses all the issues:


1. Uses EDI `KP bldg` field as the primary source for building_code
2. Implements the correct fallback chain for BCI: Invoice → Location_Number → Master Lookup → building_code
3. Handles multiple building codes with EMID disambiguation
4. Renames business_unit to bldg_business_unit to avoid confusion
5. Adds both region types: building_region (operations) and onelink_region (AP)
6. Implements LOC → kp_loc_ref → building_code fallback
7. Parses BCI Customer field to extract job_code after the colon
8. Flags cases for investigation when multiple building codes can't be resolved


The transformer now properly chains the lookups and should give you 100% (or close to it) population for both building_code and business_unit fields!


## Human:

Can you create this as an artifact so I can easily download it as a .py script?


## Claude:

I'll create the fixed transformer as a downloadable Python script for you.


## Human:

Continue


## Claude:

Perfect! I've created the fixed EDI-based transformer as a downloadable Python script. This updated transformer includes all the corrections we discussed:


Key Fixes Implemented:


1. Uses EDI `KP bldg` field as the primary source for building_code
2. Correct BCI fallback chain: Invoice → Location_Number → Master Lookup → building_code (with EMID disambiguation)
3. Correct AUS fallback chain: Invoice → Job Number → Master Lookup → building_code (with EMID disambiguation)
4. Renamed business_unit to bldg_business_unit to avoid confusion with EDI's BUSINESS UNIT field
5. Added LOC → kp_loc_ref → building_code fallback when EDI doesn't have building code
6. Parses BCI Customer field to extract job_code after the colon
7. Tracks building_region and onelink_region separately (though these need to be added to UnifiedInvoiceDetail)
8. Flags multiple building codes for investigation when EMID disambiguation doesn't resolve to a single code


To Use This Script:


1. First update `unified_invoice_schema.py` to add these fields to the UnifiedInvoiceDetail class:
python`building_region: Optional[str] = None
onelink_region: Optional[str] = None`
2. Save the script as `fixed_edi_transformer.py`
3. Run it:
bash`python fixed_edi_transformer.py`


This should fix the 0% population issue for both business_unit and building_code by properly using the EDI data and implementing the correct fallback chains. The script will also provide detailed statistics about how many records used fallback lookups and flag any cases where multiple building codes couldn't be resolved to a single value.


## Human:

I updated the UnifiedInvoiceDetail class, but I am still getting the prompt to update before running. Do I need to uncomment anything?


## Claude:

Yes! You need to uncomment the last line in the script to actually run the transformation. Look at the very bottom of the `main` block:


```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Note for user about updating unified schema
    print("\n" + "="*60)
    print("IMPORTANT: Before running this script...")
    print("=" * 60)
    print("\n1. Update unified_invoice_schema.py to add these fields to UnifiedInvoiceDetail:")
    print("   - building_region: Optional[str] = None")
    print("   - onelink_region: Optional[str] = None")
    print("\n2. Then run: python fixed_edi_transformer.py")
    print("\nThis will reprocess all data with the fixed lookup logic.")
    print("=" * 60)
    
    # Uncomment to run
    # unified_df = reprocess_with_fixed_transformer()  # <-- UNCOMMENT THIS LINE
```


Change the last line from:


```python
# unified_df = reprocess_with_fixed_transformer()
```


To:


```python
unified_df = reprocess_with_fixed_transformer()
```


This will actually execute the transformation process. The script was set up to just show the instructions by default, but now that you've updated the schema, you can uncomment that line and run the full transformation!


## Human:

It ran successfully, but the issue has not been resolved


## Claude:

I see the issue - we're still getting 0% for business_unit and building_code. This means our lookups aren't working as expected. Let me diagnose what's happening.


The problem is likely that the EDI data in the Invoice dimension isn't properly storing the `KP bldg` field. Let's create a diagnostic script to check what's actually in our dimension tables:

Run this diagnostic script first to see what's actually in the dimension tables. This will help us understand:


1. Whether the Invoice dimension has BUILDING_CODE populated
2. Whether the Building dimension has BUSINESS_UNIT populated
3. What the actual column name is for building codes in the EDI data
4. Whether our lookups are finding the data


Based on the output, we can determine exactly where the lookup chain is breaking down.


## Human:

Results are attached


## Claude:

Perfect! Now I can see the issue. The diagnostic shows:


1. Invoice Dimension HAS building codes - 4899/7695 (63.7%) filled
2. Building Dimension HAS business units - 349/381 (91.6%) filled
3. EDI data HAS building codes in the 'KP bldg' column


But our transformer is getting 0% for both fields. This means the lookup logic in the transformer isn't working correctly.


The issue is that our `get_invoice_dimensions()` method is looking for the wrong field name. In the Invoice dimension, it's stored as `BUILDING_CODE`, but we're trying to get it with `'KP bldg'`.


Let me create a fix for the transformer:


```python
def diagnose_transformer_lookup():
    """Test the actual lookup logic to see why it's failing"""
    
    print("TESTING TRANSFORMER LOOKUP LOGIC")
    print("=" * 60)

if __name__ == "__main__":

```


But I think I've already spotted the issue. In the `get_invoice_dimensions()` method, we need to fix how we're extracting the building code. The Invoice dimension has it as `BUILDING_CODE`, not `KP bldg`.


Here's the corrected `get_invoice_dimensions()` method:


```python
def get_invoice_dimensions(self, invoice_number: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """
    Get all dimensional data for an invoice from EDI
    Now properly extracts BUILDING_CODE from the dimension table
    """
    invoice_str = str(invoice_number).strip()
    
    # Direct lookup
    if invoice_str in self.invoice_lookup:
        edi_data = self.invoice_lookup[invoice_str]
        
        result = {
            'EMID': edi_data.get('EMID'),
            'SERVICE_AREA': edi_data.get('SERVICE_AREA'),
            'BUILDING_CODE': edi_data.get('BUILDING_CODE'),  # It's already BUILDING_CODE in the dimension!
            'GL_BU': edi_data.get('GL_BU'),
            'GL_LOC': edi_data.get('GL_LOC'),
            'GL_DEPT': edi_data.get('GL_DEPT'),
            'GL_ACCT': edi_data.get('GL_ACCT'),
            'ONELINK_REGION': edi_data.get('REGION'),
            'ONELINK_STATUS': edi_data.get('ONELINK_STATUS'),
            'PAID_DATE': edi_data.get('PAID_DATE')
        }
        
        # If no building code, try LOC lookup
        if not result['BUILDING_CODE'] and result.get('GL_LOC'):
            loc_str = str(result['GL_LOC'])
            if loc_str in self.loc_to_building:
                result['BUILDING_CODE'] = self.loc_to_building[loc_str]
                self.transformation_stats['warnings'].append(
                    f"Used LOC {loc_str} to find building {result['BUILDING_CODE']}"
                )
        
        self.transformation_stats['invoices_matched'] += 1
        return result
    
    # Rest of the method stays the same...
```


The issue was that we were looking for `'KP bldg'` in the lookup result, but the dimension table has already standardized it to `'BUILDING_CODE'`. Let me create a quick fix script that patches just this method:


## Human:

Still not joining properly :(

I see - we're still getting 0% for both fields. Let me create a more thorough diagnostic to trace exactly where the lookup is failing:

This diagnostic will trace through every step of the lookup process to see exactly where it's failing. Run this and let's see what happens at each stage.


Also, I noticed in your previous output that there might be an issue with the column names. The diagnostic will show us the exact column names and their values, which will help us identify any naming mismatches.


## Human:


## Claude:

Excellent! Now I can see the exact issue. The diagnostic shows:


1. Invoice found in lookup ✓
2. BUILDING_CODE is there (CA251-1) ✓
3. But `get_invoice_dimensions` returns `nan` for BUILDING_CODE ❌


This means the problem is in how we're accessing the data in the `get_invoice_dimensions` method. The issue is that when we get `nan` values from pandas, they need to be handled properly.


Here's the fix - we need to check for pandas NaN values:


```python
def get_invoice_dimensions(self, invoice_number: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """
    Get all dimensional data for an invoice from EDI
    Fixed to handle NaN values properly
    """
    invoice_str = str(invoice_number).strip()
    
    # Direct lookup
    if invoice_str in self.invoice_lookup:
        edi_data = self.invoice_lookup[invoice_str]
        
        # Helper function to handle NaN values
        def get_value(key):
            val = edi_data.get(key)
            # Check if it's NaN (pandas null value)
            if pd.isna(val):
                return None
            return val
        
        result = {
            'EMID': get_value('EMID'),
            'SERVICE_AREA': get_value('SERVICE_AREA'),
            'BUILDING_CODE': get_value('BUILDING_CODE'),
            'GL_BU': get_value('GL_BU'),
            'GL_LOC': get_value('GL_LOC'),
            'GL_DEPT': get_value('GL_DEPT'),
            'GL_ACCT': get_value('GL_ACCT'),
            'ONELINK_REGION': get_value('REGION'),
            'ONELINK_STATUS': get_value('ONELINK_STATUS'),
            'PAID_DATE': get_value('PAID_DATE')
        }
        
        # If no building code, try LOC lookup
        if not result['BUILDING_CODE'] and result.get('GL_LOC'):
            loc_str = str(result['GL_LOC'])
            if loc_str in self.loc_to_building:
                result['BUILDING_CODE'] = self.loc_to_building[loc_str]
                self.transformation_stats['warnings'].append(
                    f"Used LOC {loc_str} to find building {result['BUILDING_CODE']}"
                )
        
        self.transformation_stats['invoices_matched'] += 1
        return result
    
    # Try without revision letter
    base_invoice = invoice_str.rstrip('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
    if base_invoice != invoice_str and base_invoice in self.invoice_lookup:
        self.transformation_stats['invoices_matched'] += 1
        self.transformation_stats['warnings'].append(
            f"Invoice {invoice_str} matched to {base_invoice} (revision stripped)"
        )
        return self.get_invoice_dimensions(base_invoice)
    
    # Not found
    self.transformation_stats['invoices_not_found'].add(invoice_str)
    return None
```


Let me create a quick patch file that fixes just this issue:


## Human:

So do I run this, then the full transformer?


## Claude:

No, you don't need to run the full transformer again. This quick fix script is a complete replacement that includes all the functionality of the full transformer plus the NaN handling fix.


Just run:


```bash
python quick_fix_nan_handling.py
```


This script:


1. Inherits all the functionality from `FixedEDIBasedTransformer`
2. Overrides just the broken `get_invoice_dimensions` method with the fix
3. Runs the complete transformation process
4. Exports the results


So it's a one-step process - this single script will give you the fully transformed data with (hopefully) proper business_unit and building_code population!


After running it, check the console output to see if the field population percentages have improved from 0%.


## Human:

This is better, but I believe I may know another reason we are not getting higher success. We cannot start with EDI invoice numbers alone, and here's why: We do not receive updated EDI files from the customer (once they confirm successful receipt of them) until well after we generate our invoice_details reports for the customer's validation tool, so we cannot always look to the EDI file for invoice numbers and building codes first. When they match, great, but if they do not, we need to use the Location_Number (BCI) or Job Number (AUS) in an attempt to identify the building code. Thoughts?


## Claude:

You're absolutely right! This is a critical insight about the timing of your business process. The EDI file is essentially a "future state" - it contains invoices that have already been validated and submitted, but when you're creating new invoice_details files, those invoices won't be in EDI yet.


So the lookup logic should be:


1. Try EDI first (for historical invoices that have already been processed)
2. If not in EDI, use the Location/Job lookups (for new invoices being prepared)


This explains why we're only getting 44-46% coverage - those are probably the historical invoices that made it into EDI, while the newer ones need the fallback logic.


Let me create an updated transformer that properly implements this dual approach:
