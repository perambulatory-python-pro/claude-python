# KAISER ETL Pipeline Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
Successfully implemented an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process TrackTik shift data for KAISER's billing periods. The pipeline processes shifts across 8 KAISER sub-regions, handling approximately 30,000 shifts per billing period.

## Key Challenges Solved

### 1. API Integration Issues
**Problem**: The TrackTik API returned 400 errors when using certain parameters.
- `include` parameter caused failures
- `account.id:in` filter format was not supported
- Sort parameters were rejected

**Solution**: 
- Removed the `include` parameter entirely
- Used `employee.region` filtering instead of account-based filtering
- Simplified API calls to use only supported parameters

### 2. Data Structure Mismatches
**Problem**: API returned different data structures than expected.
- `region` field was an integer ID, not an object
- `account` field in shifts was always `None`
- Shifts only contained ID references, not full objects

**Solution**:
- Updated all model classes to handle both integer IDs and object formats
- Implemented position-to-client lookup since shifts don't have direct client references
- Created defensive code to handle multiple data formats

### 3. Database Constraint Violations
**Problem**: NOT NULL constraints on `client_id` in fact_shifts table.
- Shifts don't have client information directly
- Some positions (2 out of 175) couldn't be mapped to clients

**Solution**:
- Query `dim_positions` table to get client mappings
- Filter out shifts without valid client mappings
- Track unmapped shifts in data quality metrics

### 4. Schema Alignment
**Problem**: Table schema didn't match the data model.
- `attendance_status` column didn't exist
- Required fields weren't always available in API responses

**Solution**:
- Removed non-existent columns from insert statements
- Aligned data transformations with actual table structure
- Added proper null handling for optional fields

## Implementation Details

### Pipeline Architecture
```
TrackTik API → ETL Pipeline → PostgreSQL Data Warehouse
     ↓              ↓                    ↓
  Shifts      Transform &         Partitioned Tables
  by Region    Validate          (by billing period)
```

### Key Components

1. **ETLPipeline** (`etl_pipeline.py`)
   - Main orchestration class
   - Processes each KAISER region sequentially
   - Handles dimension loading and shift processing

2. **TrackTikClient** (`tracktik_client.py`)
   - API authentication and request handling
   - Pagination support for large datasets
   - Rate limiting and retry logic

3. **Data Models** (`models.py`)
   - DimEmployee, DimClient, DimPosition, DimRegion
   - FactShift with partitioned table support
   - SCD Type 2 dimension handling

4. **Transformers** (`transformers.py`)
   - Convert API responses to warehouse schema
   - Handle timezone conversions
   - Data type safety and validation

### Processing Flow

1. **Load Region Mapping**
   - Query database for KAISER region IDs
   - Map region names to IDs for filtering

2. **Process Each Region**
   - Get clients for the region
   - Load/update dimension tables (clients, positions)
   - Retrieve shifts filtered by employee.region
   - Transform shift data
   - Look up client IDs from positions
   - Insert validated shifts into fact table

3. **Data Quality Checks**
   - Track shifts without client mappings
   - Log transformation errors
   - Validate required fields before insert

## Results

### Successful Processing Stats
- **Total Shifts Loaded**: 29,695
- **Total Employees**: 2,658
- **Processing Time**: ~5 minutes for full run
- **Error Rate**: 0% (2 shifts filtered due to missing client mapping)

### Regional Breakdown
| Region | Shifts | Employees |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| S California | 19,746 | 1,694 |
| N California | 4,343 | 423 |
| MidAtlantic | 2,201 | 215 |
| Washington | 1,108 | 111 |
| Georgia | 820 | 81 |
| Colorado | 798 | 74 |
| Hawaii | 617 | 51 |
| Northwest | 62 | 9 |

## Technical Decisions

1. **Filter by Employee Region**: Since shifts don't have account info, we filter by employee.region which maps to KAISER regions.

2. **Position-to-Client Lookup**: Essential for billing since shifts need client attribution but don't have it directly.

3. **Batch Processing**: Process regions sequentially to manage memory and API rate limits.

4. **Data Quality Over Completeness**: Filter out shifts we can't properly attribute rather than insert incomplete data.

## Future Improvements

1. **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple regions concurrently with proper rate limiting
2. **Employee Details**: Fetch full employee information instead of minimal records
3. **Incremental Updates**: Only process new/changed shifts since last run
4. **Position 3758 Investigation**: Resolve why this position lacks client mapping
5. **Billing Rate Integration**: Pull billing rates from API summary objects

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Documentation vs Reality**: Always test API endpoints directly before building complex logic
2. **Defensive Programming**: Handle multiple data formats when working with external APIs
3. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component in isolation before full integration
4. **Data Exploration First**: Understand actual data structure before designing transformations

## Conclusion

The KAISER ETL pipeline is now production-ready and successfully processes billing period data. The implementation handles real-world data inconsistencies gracefully and provides clear logging for monitoring and debugging.
