# Python Project Collaboration Instructions

## Project Context & Goals
- This project will be ongoing and serve as a historical record for our prior chats, artifacts, etc. so I will be able to reference these in the future. My goal is to gain an advanced level of understanding and ability with python coding.

**Primary Objective:** 
- Create accurate, efficient, and clean code while gaining experience and capabilities with python.

**Current Status:**
- Beginner level python knowledge.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Ability to provide better prompts to Claude when working with him on code
- Ability to do much of the coding myself
- Troubleshoot problems with code

## Technical Environment

**Python Version:** 
- Python 3.13.5

**Key Libraries/Frameworks:**
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib

**Development Environment:**
- IDE/Editor: VS Code
- Operating System: Windows 11

## Project Structure & Files

**GitHub Repository:** 
- https://github.com/perambulatory-python-pro/claude-python

**Key Files to Reference:**
- `scripts/excel_date_standardizer.py` - formats all date columns to yyyy-mm-dd
- `scripts/invoice_app.py` - comprehensive streamlit app that helps format, clean, and process multiple source files into staging files that are then used to update a master file. 
- `scripts/invoice_master_upsert_system.py` - first build of invoice process tracking 
- `documentation/project_summary.md` - a summary of the work we did before creating the project. Provides context to some of the use case I have for python, for my limited knowledge, and our troubleshooting success.

## Communication Preferences

### When Providing Code Help:
- **Explanation Level:** Beginner
- **Code Comments:** Moderate
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive
- **Testing:** Include unit tests? Yes

### Response Format Preferences:
- **Code Structure:** Provide your recommendations based upon my skill level
- **Documentation Style:** Provide your recommendations based upon my skill level
- **Example Data:** Include sample inputs/outputs? Yes

## Current Challenges & Focus Areas

**Immediate Needs:**
- What specific problems are you trying to solve right now?
  - Currently solving for the very manual processes we have with data analysis.

**Learning Goals:**
- What Python concepts do you want to improve? All of them, but will focus on the concepts that are part of the current problems we are attempting to solve.

**Performance Considerations:**
- Are speed, memory usage, or scalability important? Speed is always helpful, but scalability and accuracy are the most important. Memory usage is not important for now - as I am processing most of this locally and I have the computing power to handle these tasks - desktop i7 14700K, 64GB DDR5 RAM, GeForce RTX 4080 GPU and a laptop with i9-14900HX, 64GB DDR5 RAM, and a GeForce RTX 4080 laptop GPU

## Questions to Help Refine These Instructions

1. What type of Python work are you primarily doing? data analysis and ETL, some web development, data visualizations
2. What's your current Python skill level? beginner
3. Do you have specific coding standards or style preferences? not at this time - please suggest and use industry best practices
4. Are there particular areas where you want more detailed explanations? Not at this time
5. What kinds of projects or problems do you work on most often? data cleansing and ETL and automation.
