# Invoice Management System Project Summary

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Build a comprehensive Python-based invoice management system to automate the processing of weekly invoice files and maintain a master database for accounts receivable tracking.

**Business Context**: The user receives weekly files (Release, Add-On, EDI) via email that need to be processed and consolidated into a master database. The system handles invoice status tracking, date preservation, and invoice revision history linking.

## Initial Requirements & Development

### Phase 1: Basic Date Standardization
**User Request**: Need to standardize date formats in Excel files from various formats (yyyymmdd, short date) to ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd).

**Solution Delivered**:
- Python script using pandas for date conversion
- Handles multiple input formats: yyyymmdd (20250619), short date (6/19/2025), already formatted dates
- Robust error handling for failed conversions
- Command-line interface for weekly processing

**Key Learning**: Started with simple date standardization, which became foundation for larger system.

### Phase 2: Complex Upsert System Requirements
**User Request**: Build sophisticated database upsert system with the following complex requirements:
- **Three file types**: Release, Add-On, EDI files with different processing logic
- **Date preservation**: Maintain original dates when records are updated multiple times
- **Invoice history linking**: Track revised invoices and create bidirectional relationships
- **Data validation**: Check for missing Invoice Numbers and date conversion failures
- **Backup system**: Automatic backups before each processing run

**Business Process Mapping**:
1. **EDI Upload**: Initial submission of invoices to customer via SFTP
2. **Validation**: Customer validates charges using validation tool
3. **Release Process**: Validated invoices are "released" weekly via email updates
4. **Add-Ons**: Revised or failed invoices submitted with subsequent EDI uploads
5. **Invoice Revisions**: Track original invoice numbers and link to revised versions

**Solution Delivered**:
- Object-oriented `InvoiceMasterManager` class
- Three specialized processing methods: `process_release_file()`, `process_addon_file()`, `process_edi_file()`
- Advanced date preservation logic (Original EDI Date, Original Add-On Date, Original Release Date)
- Bidirectional invoice history linking via "Invoice No. History" field
- Comprehensive logging and backup system
- Duplicate detection and quality reporting

## Advanced Features & Streamlit GUI

### Phase 3: Web Application Development
**User Request**: Convert command-line scripts into user-friendly web interface using Streamlit.

**Solution Delivered**:
- Professional Streamlit web application with 7 main sections:
  1. **Home Page**: Dashboard with quick statistics and one-click processing
  2. **File Converter**: Convert email source files to standardized format
  3. **Release Processing**: Handle weekly release file uploads
  4. **Add-On Processing**: Process add-on files with invoice linking
  5. **EDI Processing**: Manage EDI submissions with date preservation
  6. **Master Data View**: Interactive database viewer with filtering
  7. **Processing Logs**: View detailed processing history

**Key Features**:
- Drag-and-drop file uploads
- Real-time processing feedback
- Interactive data tables
- CSV export functionality
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

### Phase 4: Source File Conversion System
**User Request**: Build intelligent file converter to transform raw email files into standardized formats for processing.

**Business Challenge**: Source files from email have different structures, extra columns, and need cleaning before processing.

**Solution Delivered**:
- **Smart file type detection**: Auto-detects Release/Add-On/EDI based on filename keywords
- **Intelligent data cleaning**: Removes empty rows and identifies actual data
- **Notes column handling**: Combines Notes with unnamed columns (vacation holds, etc.)
- **Quality validation**: Checks for missing Invoice Numbers and date conversion issues
- **Bulk upload capability**: Process 2-3 files simultaneously with auto-detection
- **Manual date input**: Set constant dates for each file type during processing

**Advanced Logic**:
- Empty row filtering using key business fields
- Unnamed column detection for additional notes
- Multi-format date parsing (ISO timestamps, yyyymmdd, short dates)
- Invoice history mapping from "Original invoice #" field

### Phase 5: Workflow Optimization
**User Request**: Streamline weekly workflow to minimize manual steps and tab switching.

**Solutions Delivered**:
- **"Process All 3 Files" button**: One-click sequential processing (Release → Add-On → EDI)
- **Static Quick Process sections**: Always available processing buttons on multiple pages
- **Seamless convert-to-process workflow**: Convert source files and immediately process them
- **Bulk file processing**: Upload multiple files, auto-detect types, set dates, and process all at once

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.x** with pandas, openpyxl, xlrd libraries
- **Streamlit** for web interface
- **Excel file processing** (.xlsx and .xls support)
- **Object-oriented design** with comprehensive error handling

### Data Structure
**Master Database Columns**:
- Core: EMID, NUID, SERVICE REQ'D BY, Service Area, Post Name
- Invoice: Invoice No., Invoice From, Invoice To, Invoice Date, Chartfield, Invoice Total
- Tracking: EDI Date, Release Date, Add-On Date, Notes, Not Transmitted
- History: Invoice No. History, Original EDI Date, Original Add-On Date, Original Release Date

### File Processing Logic
1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove empty rows, validate required fields
2. **Date Standardization**: Convert all date formats to yyyy-mm-dd
3. **Type-Specific Processing**: Handle Release/Add-On/EDI unique requirements
4. **Upsert Logic**: Update existing records or create new ones
5. **Date Preservation**: Maintain historical dates when records change
6. **Quality Reporting**: Document all processing results and issues

### Advanced Features
- **Automatic backups** with timestamps
- **Comprehensive logging** with session management
- **Invoice search** by number with partial matching
- **Multi-filter system**: Service Area, Post Name, Approver (SERVICE REQ'D BY)
- **CSV export** with filtered data
- **Responsive UI** with real-time feedback
